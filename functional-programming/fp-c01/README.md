# Some Programming Paradigms


* Impreative
    - Machine code, Assembly language

* Procedural
    - Fortran, Cobol, Algol, Basic, C

* Object Oriented
    - Java, C++, C#, Smaltalk, Python

* Declarative
    - SQL, XML, (HTML)

* Logic
    - Prolog, Planner


### A Brief History of Functional Programming

* 1950s McCarthy - LISP
* 1960s Iverson  - APL
* 1970s Backu's paper - FP
* 1970 Milner - ML (Ocaml)
* 1980s Haskell


Why learning functional programming?

"Do it whenerver it is convenient
and think hard about the decision
when it isn't convenient"

"In a completely pure system,
race conditions are impossible"

John Carmack


### Learning

* First-class functions
  * In [here](./fclass-functions) had a folders. At before folder the code has some problems.
  * in after folders has some  better code, using function methods
  * At assignments folder has a problem and solution to improve the after code
* Pure functions
  * In [here](./pure-functions) had a folders. At before folder the code has some problems.
  * in after folders has some  better code, using function methods
  * At assignments folder has a problem and solution to improve the after code
* Immutable variables and objects
  * In [here](./immutable-variables) had a folders. At before folder the code has some problems.
  * in after folders has some  better code, using function methods
  * At assignments folder has a problem and solution to improve the after code
* Lazy evaluation
  * In [here](./lazy-evaluation)
* Recursion ( instead of iterative )
* Pattern matching
  * In [here](./matching)
